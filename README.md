This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To open this project in a Dev Container using Visual Studio Code:

    Ensure Prerequisites:
        Docker: Install Docker if you haven't already.
        VS Code Dev Containers Extension: Install the Dev Containers Extension.

    Docker Desktop on Mac
        Go to Settings > Choose file sharing implementation for your containers > Choose gRPC FUSE

    Set INK_GPG_HOME Environment Variable
        # Add this to your shell rc file
        export INK_GPG_HOME=$(gpgconf --list-dirs agent-socket)
        # OR use this if youre unsure
        echo 'export INK_GPG_HOME=$(gpgconf --list-dirs agent-socket)' >> "$HOME/.$(basename $SHELL)rc"

    Open in VS Code:
        If you haven't already, open this project in Visual Studio Code.

    Reopen in Dev Container:
        Press F1 (or Ctrl+Shift+P).
        Select Dev Containers: Reopen in Container.

        # If you want to open a different directory
        Select Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container

VS Code will now build and open the project in a fully configured Dev Container environment. ðŸš€

Create `.env.local` file with the follwoing defined `HUB_SPOT_TOKEN_ACCESS=<TOKEN>`
First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
